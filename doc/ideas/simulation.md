Graph theory ideas:

  * Identify loners for negotiation purposes, especially if they have rare resources?
  * identify cliques...lower tariffs? better negotiations? Less hostile?

  * find shortest paths, especially with weighted graph for determining optimal routes.
    * Use events like skirmishes, wars, space anomalies to push weight of an edge up for a time period.

  * Use directed graphs for all source/destination pairings to make flow networks and calculate congestion?
