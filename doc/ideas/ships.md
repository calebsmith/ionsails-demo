# Ships


## Components

* Shields
    * energy?
    * Thick hulls for nukes
* EMP
* weapons
    * Lasers - Long range. stealthy. difficult to aim. low latency
    * railguns - like lasers
    * homing Kamikaze nanobots - long range. expensive. easier aim. higher latency
    * Nuclear weapons - short range. continued targeting
* Bridge
* Navigation
    * Databases
* Engineering:
    * Ion propulsion
    * heat sinks
    * FTL core
* Docking bays/airlocks

## Game mechanics in ships

* Combat:
    * Manuvering:
        * For evasion
        * Positioning for short range weapony (nukes) vs. long range
    * Directional shielding?
        * Move shield strength based on expected source(s) of attacks
    * Targeting weaponry
    * fire at will? toggle? Fire on command?
    * send/defend against raiding parties (very short distances) 

* Sighting uncharted planets/celestial bodies?

* Cargo:
    * Contraband or rare goods
    * Transport of personnel
    * secure transfer of Intellectual property in computer system

* repairs - dedicate resources for repairs and wait before subsystem is operational (possibly not useable during repair in progress?)
* subsystems offline (no safe FTL w/o navigation)
