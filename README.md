## Getting Started

### Project Overview

* Build tools
  - CLJS compilation, dependency management, REPL, & hot reload: [`shadow-cljs`](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs)
* Development tools
  - Debugging: [CLJS DevTools](https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-devtools)
  - Emacs integration: [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)

#### Directory structure

* [`/`](/../../): project config files
* [`dev/`](dev/): source files compiled only with the [dev](#running-the-app) profile
  - [`user.cljs`](dev/cljs/user.cljs): symbols for use during development in the
[ClojureScript REPL](#connecting-to-the-browser-repl-from-a-terminal)
* [`resources/public/`](resources/public/): SPA root directory;
[dev](#running-the-app) / [prod](#production) profile depends on the most recent build
  - [`index.html`](resources/public/index.html): SPA home page
    - Dynamic SPA content rendered in the following `div`:
        ```html
        <div id="app"></div>
        ```
    - Customizable; add headers, footers, links to other scripts and styles, etc.
  - Generated directories and files
    - Created on build with either the [dev](#running-the-app) or [prod](#production) profile
    - `js/compiled/`: compiled CLJS (`shadow-cljs`)
      - Not tracked in source control; see [`.gitignore`](.gitignore)
* [`src/ionsails/`](src/ionsails/): SPA source files (ClojureScript,
[re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame))
  - [`core.cljs`](src/ionsails/core.cljs): contains the SPA entry point, `init`
* [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/): contains the
[github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) pipelines.
  - [`test.yaml`](.github/workflows/test.yaml): Pipeline for testing.

### Environment Setup

1. Install [JDK 8 or later](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) (Java Development Kit)
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (JavaScript runtime environment) which should include
   [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) or if your Node.js installation does not include NPM also install it.
5. Clone this repo and open a terminal in the `ionsails` project root directory

### Browser Setup

Browser caching should be disabled when developer tools are open to prevent interference with
[`shadow-cljs`](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) hot reloading.

Custom formatters must be enabled in the browser before
[CLJS DevTools](https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-devtools) can display ClojureScript data in the
console in a more readable way.

## Development

### Running the App

Start a temporary local web server, build the app with the `dev` profile, and serve the app,
browser test runner and karma test runner with hot reload:

```sh
npm install
npx shadow-cljs watch app
```

Please be patient; it may take over 20 seconds to see any output, and over 40 seconds to complete.

When `[:app] Build completed` appears in the output, browse to
[http://localhost:8280/](http://localhost:8280/).

[`shadow-cljs`](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) will automatically push ClojureScript code
changes to your browser on save. To prevent a few common issues, see
[Hot Reload in ClojureScript: Things to avoid](https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2019/08/25/hot-reload-in-clojurescript.html#things-to-avoid).

Opening the app in your browser starts a
[ClojureScript browser REPL](https://clojurescript.org/reference/repl#using-the-browser-as-an-evaluation-environment),
to which you may now connect.

#### Connecting to the browser REPL from Emacs with CIDER

Connect to the browser REPL:
```
M-x cider-jack-in-cljs
```

See
[Shadow CLJS User's Guide: Emacs/CIDER](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#cider)
for more information. Note that the mentioned [`.dir-locals.el`](.dir-locals.el) file has already
been created for you.

#### Connecting to the browser REPL from VS Code with Calva

See the [re-frame-template README](https://github.com/day8/re-frame-template) for [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva) instuctions. See also https://calva.io for Calva documentation.

#### Connecting to the browser REPL from a terminal

1. Connect to the `shadow-cljs` nREPL:
    ```sh
    lein repl :connect localhost:8777
    ```
    The REPL prompt, `shadow.user=>`, indicates that is a Clojure REPL, not ClojureScript.

2. In the REPL, switch the session to this project's running build id, `:app`:
    ```clj
    (shadow.cljs.devtools.api/nrepl-select :app)
    ```
    The REPL prompt changes to `cljs.user=>`, indicating that this is now a ClojureScript REPL.
3. See [`user.cljs`](dev/cljs/user.cljs) for symbols that are immediately accessible in the REPL
without needing to `require`.

### Running `shadow-cljs` Actions

See a list of [`shadow-cljs CLI`](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_command_line)
actions:
```sh
npx shadow-cljs --help
```

Please be patient; it may take over 10 seconds to see any output. Also note that some actions shown
may not actually be supported, outputting "Unknown action." when run.

Run a shadow-cljs action on this project's build id (without the colon, just `app`):
```sh
npx shadow-cljs <action> app
```
### Debug Logging

The `debug?` variable in [`config.cljs`](src/cljs/ionsails/config.cljs) defaults to `true` in
[`dev`](#running-the-app) builds, and `false` in [`prod`](#production) builds.

Use `debug?` for logging or other tasks that should run only on `dev` builds:

```clj
(ns ionsails.example
  (:require [ionsails.config :as config])

(when config/debug?
  (println "This message will appear in the browser console only on dev builds."))
```

## Production

Build the client using the client_build.sh script. This will place everything into a build/
folder

```sh
./client_build.sh
```

This also creates `app.js` and `manifset.edn` files inside of the `resources/public/js/compiled` directory and can be used directly for local testing.
